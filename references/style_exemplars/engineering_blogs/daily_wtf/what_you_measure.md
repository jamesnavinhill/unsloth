  *[ M1]: The first generally available Apple CPU ("Apple Silicon") for laptops with 4 Firestorm and 4 Icestorm cores.
  *[uop]: Micro-operation: instructions are translated into one or more uops, which are simple operations executed by the CPU's execution units.
  *[macro-fuse]: The fusing of an ALU operation and subsequent jump, such as `dec eax; jnz label` into one operation
  *[macro-fused]: The fusing of an ALU operation and subsequent jump, such as `dec eax; jnz label` into one operation
  *[uarch]: Microarchitecture: a specific implementation of an ISA, e.g., "Haswell microarchitecture".
  *[p1]: port 1 (GP and SIMD ALU, integer mul)
  *[p6]: port 6 (GP ALU, all branches)
  *[immediate]: When discussing assembly instructions an immediate is a value embedded in the instruction itself, e.g., the 1 in add eax, 1.
  *[p5]: port 5 (GP and SIMD ALU, vector shuffles)
  *[p0]: port 0 (GP and SIMD ALU, not-taken branches)
  *[M1]: The first generally available Apple CPU ("Apple Silicon") for laptops with 4 Firestorm and 4 Icestorm cores.
  *[naturally aligned]: Naturally aligned data is data whose location in memory is a multiple of its size, e.g., a 4 byte element whose address is a multiple of 4 bytes.
  *[AGU]: Address Generation Unit
  *[p2]: port 2 (load/store AGU)
  *[p3]: port 3 (load/store AGU)
  *[p7]: port 7 (limited store AGU)
  *[CNL]: Intel's Cannon Lake (client) architecture, the i3-8121U was the only SKU ever released
  *[SKX]: Intel's Skylake (server) architecture including Skylake-SP, Skylake-X and Skylake-W
  *[SKL]: Intel's Skylake (client) architecture, aka 6th Generation Intel Core i3,i5,i7
  *[HSW]: Intel's Haswell architecture, aka 4th Generation Intel Core i3,i5,i7
  *[out-of-order]: Out-of-order execution allows CPUs to execute instructions out of order with respect to the source.
  *[MSROM]: Intel's name for the microcode engine: a component handles complex instructions which require more than 4 uops using microcode which feeds uops directly into the IDQ.
  *[MITE]: Intel's name for the "legacy" decoder, i.e., the decoder that usually decodes instructions when they are not found in the MSROM.
  *[microcode]: Internal instructions and other logic forming part of a CPU which may be used to implement user-visible instructions and control other aspects of CPU behavior and which may be modified dynamically by vendor-provided updates.
  *[LSD]: Lysergic acid diethylamide or Loop stream detector, but in the context of this blog probably the latter: The so-called loop buffer that can cache small loops of up to ~64 uops on recent Intel architectures. Not actually a separate structure: the hardware justs locks the loop down in the IDQ.
  *[basic block]: a straight-line code sequence with no branches in except to the entry and no branches out except at the exit (Wikipedia).
  *[OoO]: Out-of-order execution allows CPUs to execute instructions out of order with respect to the source.
  *[Sunny Cove]: The new 7nm microarchitecture used in Ice Lake CPUs.
  *[Firestorm]: The big, high IPC cores in the Apple M1 CPU.
  *[Icestorm]: The low power efficiency cores in the Apple M1 CPU.
  *[ROB]: Re-order buffer: n ordered buffer which stores in-progress instructions on an out-of-order processor.
  *[IPC]: Instructions per cycle: calculated over an interval by measuring the number of instructions executed and the duration in cycles.
  *[MLP]: Memory level parallelism: having multiple misses to memory outstanding from a single core. When used as a metric, it refers to the average number of outstanding requests over some period.
  *[demand load]: A true load that appears in the source code or assembly, as opposed to loads initiated by software or hardware prefetch.
  *[PRF]: Physical register file: The hardware registers used for renaming architectural (source visible) registers, usually much larger in number than the architectural register count.
  *[SIMD]: Single Instruction Multiple Data: an ISA type or ISA extension like Intel's AVX or ARM's NEON that can perform multiple identical operations on elements packed into a SIMD register.
  *[GP]: General purpose: as opposed to SIMD or FP. On x86 often refers to instructions such as integer addition, or registers such as eax.
  *[delamination]: An situation where an instruction using an indexed addressing mode, that is otherwise eligible for micro-fusion, stays fused in the uop-cache, but then delaminates into two separate uops prior to issue, and so counts as two against the pipeline (rename) limit of four uops.
  *[IDQ]: Queue that collects incoming instructions from the decoder, uop cache or microcode engine and delivers them to the renamer (RAT).
  *[RMW]: Read-modify-write: an instruction that reads from a memory location, operates on the value, and writes the result back to the same location.
